        <p class="planetContent">Welcome to planet Mercury! This is the smallest planet in the entire Sol system. 
            It is the closest orbiting planet to our sun; by extension, it is also the hottest planet 
            within our solar system. The closer a planet is to the sun, the faster it moves on its orbit. 
            Mercury moves at roughly 29 miles per second within its orbit around the sun. This planet has 
            the highest temperature extremes in the entire solar system due to its close proximity to the sun. 
            The planet has no moons nor any rings. It is what is considered a terrestrial planet, meaning it is 
            very rocky in nature. Life as we know it could not possibly exist on mercury due to the extreme heat 
            and pressure. If you want to learn more about mercury, visit 
            <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mercury/overview/" target="_blank">Nasa's</a> website 
            for further information.

            <ul>
                <li>If you stood on Mercury's surface at the closest point to the sun, our star would 
                    appear over three times larger than it does here on Earth!
                </li>
                <li>Two Nasa missions have already been to mercury!</li>
                <li>You could not breathe on Mercury as the atmosphere is very thin 
                    and it is composed of many elements organic life cannot safely breathe!

Project Sol Notes:

index.html file

- Found icon package with most major planets in it. Use these for each page as per content type. i.e. earth icon for earth page.
- Add links into certain parts of <p> content as project progresses 
- fix the search bar on the home page and make it actually function (will be done during the JS part of the project)
- With HTML in place for home page begin formatting in CSS stylesheet.
- All images and icons have been placed within the images folder inside of the project 2 folder
- refresh on creating and altering different types of forms.
- HTML validated for Homepage at 7:40pm 10/20/2022 (No errors detected)

guide.html file
- All images and icons have been placed within the images folder inside of the project 2 folder
- Needs a site navigation bar added at the top of the page (overlooked during conceptualization phase)
- Might make images clickable to lead to linked content pages, for the time being sticking with clicking the header abover each image
- need to alphabetize list of planets for ease of use
- HTML validated for guide at 9:30pm 10/20/2022 (No errors detected)

CSS stylesheet implementation
- updated icon on the top bar to show a different planet for each webpage accessed within the site.
- organized the base layout of the currently created pages 
- I intend to build upon and use the format i used on the mercury.html page on the other planet pages as well.
- AS OF NOW MERCURY IS THE ONLY HTML PAGE ADDED --> the others will be added during further development.
- I made the links to the future html pages for earth and venus, but will implement said pages further along
  during development.
- Had issues adding bullets to list, will need to follow up on this later...
- added an image as background for header and footer instead of some bland color.
- used an extensive number of classes to help organize my formatting. did this because i had multiple format overlap 
  issues between lists. carried it through rest of project to ensure ease of modification.

Second Sprint Updates and Changes

index.html file
- added functional carousel for introductory images(code to make it function located within script.js file)
- implemented functionality of the search bar(used google search engine, searching for site specific pages within my site came with to many
  complications.)

guide.html
- made images clickable(linked them to the HTML pages for their respective planets.)
- added an accordion to this page. It has three sections so far(one for each planet that currently has an HTML page)
- the accordion drops down to display quick facts about the planet it is underneath on the page.

contact.html
- added fun little transition to the astronaut image(he points with his other arm when you hover over his image.)
- fixed email feature to function normally now.
- removed text input section as it was no longer needed

mercury.html, earth.html and venus.html
- added unique icons as bullet points for the unordered lists on each page.
- added link to each paragraph to nasa website for each planet.

CSS stylesheet implementation
- more planets were added, stylesheets updated and cleaned up to reduce redundancy as much as possible
- NEED TO FORMAT PARAGRAPHS TO LOOK MORE APPEALING
- realignment of accordion for more attractive viewing needs to be done.
- base formatting for site solidly in place 
- maybe spruce up contact page if time permits.

script.js
- implementation of accordion

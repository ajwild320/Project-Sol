        <p class="planetContent">Welcome to planet Earth! Our home planet is third in line in terms
            of distance from the sun. This means earth sits far enough away that the sun did not just 
            burn/blast away its atmosphere! Since earth's core is dense enough to spawn a strong 
            magnetic field, This means the planet formed an atmosphere to repel or outright burn up 
            foreign objects upon entry into said atmosphere. Earth is the only planet within the solar
            system that hosts liquid water(H2O). This unique aspect of earth's environment earns it
            it's nickname "The Blue Marble". Earth's atmosphere is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 
            1% other elements. Since humans evolved on earth, this is the perfect combination of elements
            in terms of the composition of air we can breathe. If you want to learn more about earth,

                <li>Planet earth was once an uninhabitable ball of molten lava and constant tectonic activity
                    early in its creation process!
